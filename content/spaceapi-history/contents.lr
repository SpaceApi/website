title: History of SpaceAPI
---
body:

* **2011**
  * The SpaceAPI project has its first traces in hacker- and makerspaces in the Netherlands

* **2012**
  * The first directory is online, it's a list of 37 spaces

* **2016**
  * The project struggled for a while and was not actively maintained anymore, so the directory and the schema were forked. First [fixme](https://fixme.ch/) (developers of the [MyHackerspace](/stuff/my-hackerspace/) Android app) forked the directory and applied the pull requests made to the original directory. Later there was a fork of the schema called [spacedirectory.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20180107132756/https://spacedirectory.org/) by people from [Coredump](https://www.coredump.ch/), who forked the schema and began active maintenance.

* **2017**
  * People involved in the original Project and the fork met in Luxembourg to discuss the future of the project. The fork was merged back into the original project.
  * The new team deployed a new server and got control over the [SpaceAPI GitHub organisation](https://github.com/SpaceApi).

* **2018**
  * [blinry](https://twitter.com/blinry) created a new [SpaceAPI logo](https://morr.cc/spaceapi-logo/).
  * We switched domains from spaceapi.net to [spaceapi.io](https://spaceapi.io) since we've lost control over the old domain. Access to the @SpaceAPI Twitter account is also not possible anymore, but we set up a new account at @space_api as well as a Mastodon account at [@spaceapi@chaos.social](https://chaos.social/@spaceapi).
